            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

            <p>
                Our mission is to create safe space for all
                where you are not discriminated on the basis of your identity, sexuality, physical
                appearance, race, disability, or age. In order to create a conducive environment to interact
                with a free and open mind, we adopt this code of conduct for the 2025 Hudson Valley Portfolio Reviews.
                It
                applies to all the events
                organized by the SUNY New Paltz Department of Design.
            </p>
            <p>
                For real discussions to take place, it is inevitable to have different expressions and
                opinions, however we will not tolerate any kind of harassment. In case of any instance of
                harassment, we will take strict action.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as organizers pledge
                to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
                for everyone, regardless of age, identity, sexual identity, orientation, physical appearance,
                race, disability, or political leanings.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Unacceptable Behavior
            </h3>
            <p>
                We wish to create an inclusive and safe environment for women where they can learn and
                express. In order to achieve the same, we strongly refrain everyone from doing the
                following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender,
                    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    body size, race, age, religion;</li>
                <li>
                    Sexual images in public spaces ;</li>
                <li>
                    Deliberate intimidation;</li>
                <li>
                    Stalking or following;</li>
                <li>
                    Harassing photography or recording;</li>
                <li>
                    Inappropriate physical contact or advances;</li>
                <li>
                    Showing pornography;</li>
                <li>
                    Unwelcome sexual attention;</li>
                <li>
                    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior;</li>
                <li>
                    Causing injury to attendees; or</li>
                <li>
                    Any form of physical violence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported.</p>

            <h3>Positive Behavior</h3>
            <p>We strongly believe it's important to pay attention to harmful language patterns. We can
                try and build a conducive atmosphere, in order to do so we may keep in mind the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be audible and speak with clarity;</li>
                <li>
                    Be a listener when someone is trying to say, and there might be people who are not
                    very well versed in your language, be patient with them;</li>
                <li>
                    Maintain your calm, address the issue;</li>
                <li>
                    Disagreements happen; it’s okay to walk away from a conversation that isn't fruitful
                    or is becoming tense;</li>
                <li>
                    If you do not like a solution someone else is proposing, explain why or you may state
                    an alternative;</li>
                <li>
                    Do not assume anyone’s gender identity, sexual preference, survivor status,
                    economic status, background, health status; or</li>
                <li>
                    Make sure to refer to people by their preferred gender pronoun. (Some people don't
                    identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, and others may prefer
                    gender-neutral pronouns. You can ask people what their preferred gender pronoun
                    is. Also, if you are unsure, address them by their name.)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>
                Where to Report an instance of harassment?
                How?
            </h3>

            <h3>Enforcement</h3>
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to follow the request
                immediately. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
                that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>Event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming
                    environment for all participants.</strong> This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the
                conference/ event, mediation with the complainant / victim in the complaint and the
                person alleged to have participated in harassing or discriminatory behavior. However, to
                preserve both the safety and the confidentiality of the complainant / victim in the
                complaint, no specific action will be taken without consultation and their approval. Any
                illegal conduct will also be reported to local authorities if needed.</p>
